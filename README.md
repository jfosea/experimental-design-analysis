# Experimental Design and Analysis
This is a repository to store all the assignments and project work that I have done for my experimental design and analysis undergraduate class. This class mainly uses R to explore different experimental designs and analyze the different statistics that are formed from it. 

## Assignment 1
### Mark Received: 78/80

Topics Covered:
+ Paired t-tests
+ Two sample t-tests (shared and unshared variance)
+ Levene's test


## Assignment 2
### Mark Received: 73.75/74

Topics Covered:
+ One-Way ANOVA
+ Kruskal-Wallis test
+ Permutation test
+ Fisher's Least Significant Difference method
+ Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference method
+ Bonferroni's method


## Assignment 3
### Mark Received: TBA

Topics Covered:
+ Variance Stabilization Methods
+ Contrasts
+ Random Effects Model

## Assignment 4
### Mark Received: TBA

Topics Covered:
+ Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD)
+ Random Block Effects in CRBD
+ Latin Square Experimental Design
+ Two Factorial Design
+ Two Factorial Design with Random Factors
+ Two Factorial Design with Fixed Factors
+ Two Factorial Design with Mixed Factors

## Assignment 5 (not yet distributed)
### Mark Received: TBA

Topics Covered (potentially):
+ Three Factor Experimental Design
+ Multiple Comparisons for a Three Factor (Fixed) Model
