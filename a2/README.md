# Assingment 2

This folder contains assignment 1. It contains the following files:

## 1) .csv files

These are the corresponding datasets used in the questions.

## 2) .Rmd 

This is the main file that I used to create my assignment output.

## 3) .R

This is where I store all the code I have done for this assignment. I find that it is better to separate markdown file with the R code.

## 4) .pdf

This is the assignment I handed in.

### Mark Received: 73.75/74
